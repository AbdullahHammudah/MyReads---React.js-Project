# MyReads Project
This app contains three shelves for categorizing your favorite books that you search and then add them to one of the shelves through an API.
We use here React.js as the main dev tool or library, and this is an educational project to apply and gain real-world hands-on experience with React.js.

## How to run?
Note: This project is not hosted on a server yet and uses a demo local server, and limited API provided by Udacity. 
To get started with the project:
* clone the repo to your local machine.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* start the development server with `npm start`.
* note: Node.js needed to be installed on your local machine. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
